## PART 1 — THEORETICAL ANALYSIS

### Q1: How Edge AI Reduces Latency and Enhances Privacy
Edge AI pushes computation closer to where data is generated—on devices like Raspberry Pi, mobile phones, microcontrollers, drones, or CCTV cameras.

#### How Edge AI Reduces Latency
- **No round trip to remote cloud servers.**
- **Processing happens locally on-device.**
- **Models are optimized (quantized + lightweight).**

**Latency Benefit Example:**
A drone detecting obstacles must avoid collisions instantly. With Edge AI, detection happens in milliseconds directly on the drone hardware.

#### How Edge AI Enhances Privacy
- **Raw data never leaves the device.**
- **Sensitive information is not exposed to the internet.**
- **Smaller attack surface.**

**Real-world Example:**
Autonomous drones for wildlife monitoring detect poachers using on-device AI, keeping images safe.

### Part 1, Q2: Quantum AI vs. Classical AI (Optimization)
#### Comparison for Optimization Problems
**Classical AI:**
- Runs on classical computers using bits.
- Limited by sequential checking of possibilities.

**Quantum AI:**
- Runs on quantum computers using qubits.
- Explores vast possibilities simultaneously.

**Industries That Could Benefit Most:**
- **Pharmaceuticals & Drug Discovery**
- **Finance**
- **Logistics & Supply Chain**
- **Materials Science**
